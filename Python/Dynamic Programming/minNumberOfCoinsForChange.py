# Min Number Of Coins For Change
# Given an array of positive integers representing coin denominations and a single non-negative integer n representing a target amount of money, write a function that returns the smallest number of coins needed to make change for (to sum up to) that target amount using the given coin denominations.

# Note that you have access to an unlimited amount of coins. In other words, if the denominations are [1, 5, 10], you have access to an unlimited amount of 1s, 5s, and 10s.

# If it's impossible to make change for the target amount, return -1.

            if denom <= amount:
