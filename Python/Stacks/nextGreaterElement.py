# Next Greater Element
# Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns a new array containing, at each index, the next element in the input array that's greater than the element at that index in the input array.

# In other words, your function should return a new array where outputArray[i] is the next element in the input array that's greater than inputArray[i]. If there's no such next greater element for a particular index, the value at that index in the output array should be -1. For example, given array = [1, 2], your function should return [2, -1].

# Additionally, your function should treat the input array as a circular array. A circular array wraps around itself as if it were connected end-to-end. So the next index after the last index in a circular array is the first index. This means that, for our problem, given array = [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 3, 0 0], the next greater element after 3 is 5, since the array is circular.

# Here is your output

def nextGreaterElement(array):
    result = [-1 for _ in range(len(array))]
    stack = []

    for idx in range(len(array) * 2):
        circularIdx = idx % len(array)
        while len(stack) > 0 and array[stack[len(stack) - 1]] < array[circularIdx]:
            top = stack.pop()
            result[top] = array[circularIdx]

        stack.append(circularIdx)

    return result


array = [2, 5, -3, -4, 6, 7, 2]
output = nextGreaterElement(array)
print("ğŸ‘‹ Output:", output)
