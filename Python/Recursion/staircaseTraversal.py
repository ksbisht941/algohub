# Staircase Traversal
# You're given two positive integers representing the height of a staircase and the maximum number of steps that you can advance up the staircase at a time. Write a function that returns the number of ways in which you can climb the staircase.

# For example, if you were given a staircase of height = 3 and maxSteps = 2 you could climb the staircase in 3 ways. You could take 1 step, 1 step, then 1 step, you could also take 1 step, then 2 steps, and you could take 2 steps, then 1 step.

# Note that maxSteps <= height will always be true.

def staircaseTraversal(height, maxSteps):
    return numberOfWaysToTop(height, maxSteps)

def numberOfWaysToTop(height, maxSteps):
    if height <= 1:
        return 1

    numberOfWays = 0

    for step in range(1, min(maxSteps, height) + 1):
        numberOfWays += numberOfWaysToTop(height - step, maxSteps)

    return numberOfWays

height = 4
maxSteps = 2
output = staircaseTraversal(height, maxSteps)
print("ðŸ‘‹ Output:", output)
